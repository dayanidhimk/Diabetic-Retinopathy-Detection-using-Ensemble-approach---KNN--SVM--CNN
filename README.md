This project focuses on detecting Diabetic Retinopathy using machine learning models â€” KNN, SVM, and CNN - by classifying retina fundus images into five categories. 
It leverages the strengths of CNN for feature extraction, while KNN and SVM serve to enhance the overall prediction. 

This project is done using Python libraries like: numpy, pandas, sklearn, joblib, tensorflow - for Model Training.
Frontend is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with Python Flask for handling real-time requests.
